## The Airport Beach Town

Negombo is 20 minutes from Colombo Airport, making it the default first or last night for most Sri Lanka itineraries. It's not the island's best beach, but it's convenient, has great seafood, and offers a low-key introduction to Sri Lankan coastal life.

### What Makes It Special

- **Proximity to Airport**: Perfect for late arrivals or early departures.
- **Fish Market**: One of Sri Lanka's largest. Visit at 6 AM for the auction.
- **Dutch Colonial Heritage**: Canals, churches, and old fortifications.

## What to Do

### Negombo Fish Market
The real attraction. Arrive at dawn to see the catch being auctioned. Chaotic, smelly, authentic.

### Dutch Canal Boat Ride
A 2-hour tour through the colonial-era canal system. Peaceful, scenic, and a nice break from the beach.

### St. Mary's Church
Massive Catholic cathedral with impressive frescoes. Negombo has a strong Catholic community due to Portuguese influence.

### Beach
The beach is fine. Not spectacular, but swimmable. Better for sunset strolls than sunbathing.

## Where to Eat

**Seafood is the move here.**

- **Lords Restaurant**: Grilled prawns, crab curry, fresh catch of the day.
- **Dolce Vita**: Italian-run, excellent pasta and pizza.
- **Beach Shacks**: Grilled fish on the sand. Negotiate prices first.

## Where to Stay

- **Luxury**: Jetwing Beach, Jetwing Blue
- **Mid-Range**: Camelot Beach Hotel, Goldi Sands
- **Budget**: Guesthouses on Lewis Place (quiet, 5 minutes from beach)

## Getting There

- **From Airport**: 20-30 minutes by taxi (~$15 USD)
- **From Colombo**: 1 hour north
- **To Kandy**: 3 hours east

## Best Time to Visit

**November to March** — Dry season, calm seas.  
**Avoid**: May-September (monsoon, rough surf).

## Insider Tips

1. **Don't Stay Too Long**: Negombo is a stopover, not a destination. 1 night is enough.
2. **Avoid Tuk-Tuk Scams**: Agree on price before getting in. Airport to Negombo should be ~$10-15.
3. **Skip the Lagoon Tour**: Overpriced and underwhelming. Do the canal tour instead.

## The Reality

Negombo won't blow your mind, but it's functional. If you're arriving late or leaving early, it's the smart choice. Otherwise, head straight to the South Coast or hill country.
