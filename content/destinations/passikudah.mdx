## Why Passikudah?

While the South Coast drowns in Instagram influencers, Passikudah remains blissfully quiet. This is Sri Lanka's East Coast at its finest: 2km of shallow, calm bay perfect for families, zero beach hawkers, and sunrises that rival any sunset.

### What Makes It Special

- **Shallow Bay**: Walk 200 meters out and the water is still waist-deep. Perfect for kids.
- **Off-Season Advantage**: When the South Coast rains (May-September), Passikudah shines.
- **No Crowds**: You'll have entire stretches of beach to yourself.

## Best Time to Visit

**April to September** — While the rest of Sri Lanka gets monsoon rains, the East Coast is dry and sunny.

## What to Do

### Snorkeling & Diving
The coral reefs here are healthier than the South. Pigeon Island National Park is a 90-minute drive north.

### Kalkudah Beach
The neighboring bay, equally stunning, even quieter.

### Batticaloa Lagoon
A 30-minute drive south. Bioluminescent plankton in the right season (July-September).

## Where to Stay

- **Luxury**: Anilana Pasikudah, Maalu Maalu Resort
- **Mid-Range**: Calm Resort & Spa
- **Budget**: Guesthouses in Kalkudah village

## Getting There

- **From Colombo**: 6-7 hours by car (A6 highway)
- **From Trincomalee**: 2 hours south
- **From Arugam Bay**: 3 hours north

## Insider Tip

Don't skip Batticaloa town. The Dutch Fort, the singing fish legend, and authentic Tamil cuisine make it worth a half-day detour.
