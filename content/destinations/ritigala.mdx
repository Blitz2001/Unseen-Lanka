## The Forgotten Monastery

Ritigala is what happens when you combine ancient Buddhist ruins, a medicinal forest, and absolute isolation. This 1st-century BCE monastery sits atop a mountain in Sri Lanka's dry zone, and almost no one visits it.

### Why It's Special

- **Untouched Ruins**: No restoration, no crowds, just raw archaeology.
- **Medicinal Forest**: The monks cultivated rare Ayurvedic plants. Many still grow wild.
- **Mystical Atmosphere**: Morning mist, monkey calls, and stone pathways through the jungle.

## What to Expect

### The Hike
A 1-hour forest trail leads to the monastery complex. Moderate difficulty. Wear good shoes.

### The Ruins
- **Stone pathways** (still intact after 2,000 years)
- **Meditation platforms** carved into rock
- **Ancient hospital** with stone baths for herbal treatments
- **Library ruins** where palm-leaf manuscripts were stored

### The Forest
Ritigala's microclimate is unique. The mountain catches moisture, creating a wet-zone forest in the middle of the dry zone. You'll see plants found nowhere else in the region.

## Best Time to Visit

**November to March** — Cooler weather, less humidity. Avoid April-May (scorching heat).

## Getting There

- **From Anuradhapura**: 1.5 hours southeast
- **From Sigiriya**: 1 hour north
- **From Polonnaruwa**: 1.5 hours west

Ritigala is perfectly positioned between the Cultural Triangle sites. Most people drive past it without knowing it exists.

## Practical Tips

- **Bring water**: No facilities on-site.
- **Hire a guide**: The ruins are spread out and easy to miss. Local guides know the medicinal plants.
- **Respect the site**: This is still considered sacred. Dress modestly.

## Why We Love It

Because it's the anti-Sigiriya. No ticket queues, no selfie sticks, no tour buses. Just you, the jungle, and 2,000 years of history.
