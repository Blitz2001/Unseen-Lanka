## The Lion Rock

Sigiriya is Sri Lanka's most iconic archaeological site. A 200-meter rock fortress built by King Kashyapa in the 5th century CE, complete with frescoes, water gardens, and a throne at the summit. It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site and absolutely worth the climb.

### What Makes It Special

- **Ancient Engineering**: Hydraulic systems that still function 1,500 years later.
- **Frescoes**: The famous "Sigiriya Maidens" — ancient paintings preserved in a rock pocket.
- **Summit Views**: 360° panorama of the Central Province jungle.

## The Climb

**1,200 steps** to the top. Takes 1.5-2 hours round trip.

- **Difficulty**: Moderate. Steep metal staircases near the top.
- **Best Time**: Start at 6:30 AM (gates open at 7 AM, arrive early). Avoid midday heat.
- **What to Bring**: Water, sunscreen, hat. No food allowed on the rock.

## What to See

### The Water Gardens
Symmetrical pools and fountains at the base. Still functional during monsoon season.

### The Frescoes
Halfway up, in a sheltered rock gallery. Only 22 remain (originally 500+).

### The Mirror Wall
Polished plaster wall with ancient graffiti from 8th-century visitors.

### The Summit
Ruins of the royal palace, throne, and cisterns. The views are worth the climb.

## Best Time to Visit

**November to April** — Dry season, cooler mornings.  
**Avoid**: Weekends and public holidays (massive crowds).

## Where to Stay

- **Luxury**: Aliya Resort & Spa, Jetwing Vil Uyana
- **Mid-Range**: Sigiriya Village, Hotel Sigiriya
- **Budget**: Guesthouses in Sigiriya town (10 minutes from the rock)

## Getting There

- **From Colombo**: 4-5 hours by car (A6 highway)
- **From Kandy**: 2.5 hours northeast
- **From Anuradhapura**: 1.5 hours south

## Combine With

Sigiriya is part of the **Cultural Triangle**. Combine with:
- **Dambulla Cave Temple** (30 minutes south)
- **Polonnaruwa** (1.5 hours east)
- **Minneriya National Park** (30 minutes east) — elephant safaris

## Insider Tips

1. **Skip Pidurangala Rock**: The "alternative viewpoint" is overhyped. Sigiriya itself is better.
2. **Hire a Guide at the Entrance**: They'll explain the history and point out details you'd miss.
3. **Bring Cash**: Entrance fee is ~$30 USD for foreigners. No cards accepted.

## The Reality

Sigiriya is touristy, but it's touristy for a reason. This is one of the world's most impressive ancient sites. Don't skip it.
