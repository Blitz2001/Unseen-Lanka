## The Two Monsoon Rule

Sri Lanka is small, but it has two completely different weather systems. Understanding this is the key to a good trip.

### West & South Coast (Colombo, Galle, Mirissa)
- **Best Time**: December to March.
- **Dry Season**: Blue skies, calm seas.
- **Monsoon (Yala)**: May to September. Expect heavy rain and rough seas.

### East Coast (Trincomalee, Arugam Bay, Pasikudah)
- **Best Time**: May to September.
- **Dry Season**: While the south rains, the east shines.
- **Monsoon (Maha)**: October to January.

## The Secret "Shoulder" Months

If you want to avoid crowds and save money, travel in **April** or **September**.

### April
- The entire island is generally warm and sunny.
- It's New Year season (Avurudu), so cultural vibes are high.

### September
- The Yala monsoon is fading.
- Prices are 30-40% lower than December.
- Great for wildlife in Minneriya (The Gathering).

## 2026 Forecast
El Niño patterns suggest a drier start to 2026. This means the South Coast season might extend well into late April. Book your beachfront villas early.
